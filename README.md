# Showkr
 
Minimalistic photo viewer.
 
## Why
 
I don't like Flickr photo browsing interface. So I made
[something](http://showkr.solovyov.net/) I like.
 
## How

[ClojureScript][], [React][], [quiescent][] and [DataScript][]. Also, I feel a lot of gratitude
towards [lein-figwheel][].

Before that it was done in [Backbone.js][] and three times as big.

## So what
 
Well, now you can use site as a service or read source code. It's pretty simple
and easy to read, in my opinion.
 
And if you want to contribute, you're more than welcome.

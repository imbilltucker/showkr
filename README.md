# Showkr

Minimalistic photo viewer.

## Why

I don't like Flickr photo browsing interface. So I made
[something](http://showkr.org) I like.

## How

With the help of [Backbone.js][], [Ender.js][], [Eco templates][] and blessing
of GNU Make.

## So what

Well, now you can use site as a service or read a source code, which I open
sourced to serve as a base for my article about writing client-side
applications:

 - [in russian](http://solovyov.net/blog/2012/01/13/showkr/)
 - [in english](http://solovyov.net/en/2012/02/11/showkr/)

And if you want to contribute, you're more than welcome.
